# [dsame](https://dsame.xoynq.com)
**dsame** is a program to decode [EAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Alert_System)/[SAME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_Area_Message_Encoding) (Emergency Alert System/Specific Area Message Encoding) alert messages. These messages are primarily used by the National Weather Service for weather-related warnings. **dsame** will decode a demodulated message, filter by SAME ([US](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/coverage/county_coverage.html)/[CA](http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=E5A4F19C-1)) and/or event code, provide readable text, or run an external program.

**DO NOT RELY ON THIS PROGRAM WHEN LOSS, DAMAGE, INJURY OR DEATH MAY OCCUR!**

###Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7+
* A [weather radio](www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/), [RTL-SDR](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/) or other receiving/source device
* A demodulator, such as [multimon-ng](https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng/) ([Windows binaries](https://github.com/cuppa-joe/multimon-ng/releases))

###Installation

For Microsoft Windows, **dsame** is distributed as a self-extracting installer, and downloads for 64-bit and 32-bit systems are available. Run the installer to install the program and optionally multimon-ng and/or rtl_fm.

For Linux and similar systems, **dsame** is available as a compressed (tar.gz or zip) archive which contains the program source. The source repository can also be cloned using `git`. Extract and run `dsame.py` using the python interpreter.

:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------
`msg`             | Message to decode. Omit to read from standard input                   | `--msg "ZCZC-WXR-RWT-020103-020209-020091-020121-029047-029165-029095-029037+0030-1051700-KEAX/NWS"`

`source`          | Source script/program. See /scripts for examples                      | `--source source.sh`

###Usage

**dsame** can decode EAS messages from the command line, directly from the output of an external command, or by capturing the ouput of a shell script/batch file or external program. Use `msg` for command line decoding. The `source` command is used to capture and decode the output of a script or program. Without one of these options, standard input is used. Press `CTRL-C` to exit the program.

####Source Scripts

Several sample source scripts and Windows batch files are provided in the `scripts` directory. If you are using a RTL-SDR device, edit the script to set the frequency, receiver gain and PPM error rate.

###Filtering Alerts

There are two comands used to filter alerts. None, one or both can be specified. The `same` command is a list of SAME area codes ([United States](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/coverage/county_coverage.html)/[Canada](http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=E5A4F19C-1)), and the `event` command is a list of event codes to monitor.

An alert must match one of each specified alert type in order to be processed. If an alert type is omitted, any alert will match that type. In most cases, using only SAME codes to filter alerts will be the best option.

###External Commands

The `call` option runs an external program, script/batch file for each alert.  The `command` option defines the command string sent to that program, script or batch file, or to standard output if the `call` option is omitted. The following variables can be used in command strings.

####Command Variables

###Sample Commands

Decoding from a text file using standard input:

`cat zczc.txt | dsame.py --same 029165`

Using a source script to decode from standard input:

`dsame.py --same 029165 --source source.sh`

Call an external script with the event type and length:

`dsame.py --same 029165 --source source.sh --call alert.sh --command "{length}" "{event}"`

Decoding a message from the command line:

`dsame.py --msg "ZCZC-WXR-RWT-020103-020209-020091-020121-029047-029165-029095-029037+0030-1051700-KEAX/NWS" --text`

Print an encoded alert string, and omit the alert text:

`dsame.py --source source.sh --no-text --command "ZCZC-{ORG}-{EEE}-{PSSCCC}+{TTTT}-{JJJHHMM}-{LLLLLLLL}-"`

Send an alert to a [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com) channel:

`dsame.py --source source.sh --call pushbullet-channel.sh --command "{event}" "{MESSAGE}"`

###Sample Text Output

>The National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill, Missouri has issued a Required Weekly Test valid until 12:30 PM for the following counties in Kansas: Leavenworth, Wyandotte, Johnson, Miami, and for the following counties in Missouri: Clay, Platte, Jackson, Cass. (KEAX/NWS)

This [experimental Pushbullet channel](https://www.pushbullet.com/channel?tag=xoynq-weather) is updated using dsame, multimon-ng and a rtl-sdr dongle on a Raspberry Pi 2.

###Known Issues

* SASMEX/SARMEX, a Mexican system for seismic alerts, is not implemented due to lack of documentation.
* A correct and complete list of ICAO location codes used by the National Weather Service messages is not available.
* Country detection may not be reliable for some locations with duplicate SAME codes.
* Date and time information may not be accurate when decoding old messages or messages from another time zone.
* Multimon-ng will not decode the same alert in succession. This should only be an issue during testing and can be avoided by alternating test alerts.
